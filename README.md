Welcome to **FUNTENDO**! Check it out here: [FUNTENDO Website](https://meherzada.github.io/FUNTENDO-WEBSITE/)

## About

This website was created as a way for me to test and improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. I wanted to create something that I found interesting, and that's how FUNTENDO came to life. It’s a fun and interactive site dedicated to some of Nintendo's most iconic characters and games.

## Features

### 1. Soundboard
The **Soundboard** page lets you experience the iconic sounds of famous Nintendo characters. You can hear their classic sound effects, and I’ve also written custom descriptions for each character.

### 2. My Gallery
On the **My Gallery** page, you can upload your own photos and edit them with stickers and stamps from classic Nintendo games. The website uses **fabric.js** to allow you to modify images, and you can:
- Save your edited images to the gallery (the browser will remember your saved images).
- Download your creations onto your local system for future enjoyment!

### 3. Device Compatibility
Please note that the website was primarily designed for desktop use, so it might not display correctly on mobile devices. However, the main goal was to showcase some cool features and provide me with a learning opportunity.

Also please note that github pages acts weird sometimes and you might need to refresh the page in order for things to run properly! (If you actually download the files and run it on your local system, everything will work much more smoothly).

## Credits

This project was a personal initiative to explore web development and Nintendo-inspired creativity. It was a fun way to experiment with different technologies while paying tribute to some of my favorite games.
